"Name of image.
Image may have multiple bounding boxes",size of the image file in bytes,"attribute of the image file.
Image width and 
image height.
These properties were added in VGG Annotator",
Number of bounding boxed in the image,identifies index of one bounding box in the image,"Describes the bounding box.
name: could be rectangle/ polygon etc.. Since the bounding box shapes coule be different.
x: x-cordinate of the bounding box upper left corner
y: y-cordinate of the bounding box lower right corner
Note that: from the image width/ height andbounding box (x,y) and (width, height) we calculated the centroid, normalized heigth and normalized weight using pandas package and claculated # of optimum clusters
","attributes for the bounding box.
E.g. class name of the object

We had four classes defined : hardhat, boots, vest , mask"
